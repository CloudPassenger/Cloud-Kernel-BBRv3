## üì¶ Project Overview

This repository provides automated daily builds of Debian kernel packages with enhanced networking and scheduling features:
- Using official Linux Kernel 6.12 source code (from [kernel.org](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/))
- Integrating patches maintained by the Debian kernel team (from [kernel-team/linux](https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/))
- **BBR Congestion Control Algorithm Updates!**
  - Updated **BBRv3 congestion control** from Google (using [xanmod/linux-patches](https://gitlab.com/xanmod/linux-patches))
  - Retained original BBRv1 algorithm (set congestion control to `bbr1` to use)
  - Integrated modified **BBRPlus** congestion control algorithm from dog250 & cx9208 (modified from [UJX6N/bbrplus-6.x_stable](https://github.com/UJX6N/bbrplus-6.x_stable))
- Low-latency task schedulers replacing the default scheduler:
  - x86_64 uses **ECHO-CPU-Scheduler** (from [hamadmarri/ECHO-CPU-Scheduler](https://github.com/hamadmarri/ECHO-CPU-Scheduler))
  - arm64 uses **Bore-Scheduler** (from [firelzrd/bore-scheduler](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler))
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64 & arm64), daily automatic builds tracking updates

## üì• Installation Guide

### Pre-built Packages

1. Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/CloudPassenger/Cloud-Kernel-BBRv3/releases)
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/CloudPassenger/Cloud-Kernel-BBRv3/releases/download/<version>/linux-{image,headers}-<version>_<arch>.deb
   ```

2. Install packages:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb
   ```

3. Update bootloader:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub && sudo reboot
   ```

### Verify Installation
After reboot:
```bash
uname -r  # Should show installed kernel version
cat /sys/kernel/debug/sched_features  # Verify ECHO/Bore scheduler features
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control  # Should display 'bbr bbrplus bbr1'
```
